<h3 style="margin-top:0px !important;">The Crystal Collar</h3>
<p>
Choice. The power to forge one's own destiny. Little in this world nor any other wields the power of choice; Well, except perhaps Bartholomew. But even then, what could possibly exceed Bartholomew's Choice?
</p><p>
For a paltry sum of 5,000 Bartholomew Bucks, Selcress of the Frozen Crown has commissioned from Bartholomew this Crystal Collar. Wrought from her own desires afloat within the Plane of Dreams, designed by the gods, and crafted by the old crotchety wizard himself, gaze upon the awesome power of the Crystal Collar, and despair!

			This set of crystal bracelets are made from shards of Levistus’ own tomb of unmelting ice. The bracelets are engraved to refract light; The light casts images of a young drow woman standing over kings, queens, and civilizations, heralding an era that may yet come to pass.<br>When placed around the neck of a familiar, a bracelet magically resizes to a snug collar. While you wear the paired bracelet, an ethereal leash, that only you can see, connects you and heightens your bond with your familiar, granting the following benefits:

			Your familiar can tap into your well of magic, gaining immunity to cold damage and empowering its attacks. Your familiar's attack bonus becomes the higher of your spell attack bonus and its base attack bonus. Additionally, your familiar's attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. While your familiar is on the same plane of existence as you, you can communicate with it telepathically.

			As an action, you utter an incantation, decrying your foes and calling upon devilish bargain. When you do so, Stygian magics well within you, and the air around you briefly plummets to -100 degrees Fahrenheit, instantly freezing all water, destroying all non-magical plants, and quenching all molten material in a 15 ft. radius centered on you. Additionally, Levi is temporarily transformed into a higher order devil of your choice from the following list based on your warlock level: a spined devil, a barbed devil (level 5), a bone devil (level 11), an ice devil (level 17), or a pit fiend (level 20). The transformation ends after 1 minute, until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell), or if Levi is reduced to zero hit points. Once you have used this feature, you may not use it again until the next dawn.

Additionally, as a reaction when you take damage and are within 60 ft. of Levi, you may magically transfer any amount of that damage, up to a maximum of Levi's remaining health, onto Levi.

As an action you may invoke Levistus' magic to cast any of the following spells at its lowest level without expending a spell slot: cause fear, find familiar, elemental weapon (cold), ice knife.<br>Additionally, while in dim light, as a 10 minute ritual, you may cast the Commune spell, targeting Levistus. Once you have used this feature, you may not use it again for seven days.
