<h2>Bartholomew's Guide to Enchanting</h2>
<p>
Greetings Adventurer!  So you’ve been struck with inspiration for how my magic could best be weaved into a physical form.  Well, that’s good to hear!  However, there are certain principles of arcane interaction that govern how an item can be made.  In this brief guide, I’ve described these rules of magic. Follow along as I walk you through a sample item to show you the proper way to submit your ideas.
</p>
<h3>
Step I: Inspiration
</h3>
<p>
Without worrying about precisely how the item will work, think about what you want it to do.
</p>
<p><i>
As an example, we’ll consider a magical sword that can shoot fire from it’s blade.
</i></p>
<h3>
Step II: Description
</h3>
<p>
Provide a single sentence describing the appearance of your item.
</p>
<p><i>
This blade could  be described as “a blade forged from iron mined from the heart of a volcano, with a ruby embedded in its pommel.” This description is fitting and symbolically represents the sword’s fire motif.
</i></p>
<h3>
Step III: Functionality
</h3>
<p>
Consider the practical application of your item and determine the mechanics that govern its use.  This should only be one or two sentences long.  The more concise the better.
</p>
<p><i>
We want the sword to be powerful in its own right, so we’ll give it a +1 magical bonus to its attack and damage rolls. We write this as “You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this sword.”
</i></p>
<p><i>
Additionally, to represent the weapon’s fiery magic, we will give it the ability to cast a spell, such as “scorching ray”. We write this as “As an action while wielding this weapon you may cast the scorching ray spell at will with a spell attack bonus of +5 to hit.”
</i></p>
<h3>
Step IV: Naming
</h3>
<p>
Determine a name for your item.
</p>
<p><i>
This sword is extremely cool, so let’s call it “Inferno”.
</i></p>
<h3>
Step V: Balancing and Rating your Item
</h3>
<p>
Last, look back at your item and determine if there’s anything that needs to be adjusted to make the item more appropriate for use in DnDTime.  Giving a hero an item that’s too powerful for them too soon can be very dangerous. See the “Balancing Guidelines” section below for guidance on determining how powerful an item really is. 
</p>
<p><i>
Inferno is a fairly powerful weapon.  It provides a +1 bonus to hit and damage, and lets you cast a second level spell at will.  Based on the guidlines below, this item would be at least a Fable, tier item, maybe even higher!  If we want Inferno to be accessible to lower level heroes, we could apply a limit to how often scorching ray can be cast, such as limiting it to once per adventure.  Finally, this item would require attunement, a key word which limits the number of items any adventurer can have equipped at once.  As a general rule, if an item is not: extremely niche in its use, a consumable, or relatively unimpactful, then the item will have attunement. With these changes our finished item will land comfortably in the fable tier.
</i></p>
<h3>
The End Result
</h3>
<p><i><strong>
Example Item - Inferno.
</strong>
Requires Attunement. 
</i>
This longsword forged from red tinted steel, has a ruby embedded in its pommel. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with Inferno. As an action while wielding Inferno you may cast the spell scorching ray with a spell attack bonus of +5 to hit. Once used, this property of the sword can’t be used again until the next dawn.

<p>
And there we have it. Another item completed for the bag. It can take some time to get the hang of balancing and writing items. Below, I’ve posted some more tips and tricks that might help if you’re struggling to determine what tier the item you’ve created is. As the majority of items I’m looking to toss in my bag at the moment are fable or story tier. Try and design within that range of power level. Additionally, below are some key words and phrases that are frequently used in item design that will help make your items better match those already in the bag. 
</p>
<p><strong>
Thanks for reading and happy crafting everyone!
</strong></p>
<h3>
Keywords
</h3>
<p>
Use these words or phrases at the beginning of your item description to categorize it as a certain type of item.
</p>
<p><strong>
Consumable. 
</strong>
An item with this keyword can only be used a limited number of times, often once. Healing potions are a simple example. Once you have used it the item is destroyed or otherwise rendered useless.
</p>
<p><strong>
Requires Attunement. 
</strong>
An item with this keyword takes up an attunement slot. A character can only wield up to three items at a time that require attunement. Use attunement on items that are powerful in all situations. Generally items that provide power consistently should require attunement, and items that provide power only in rare situations should not. If an item is designed with a specific alignment or class in mind you can specify that only that type of individual can attune to this item. For example, requires attunement by a cleric, or requires attunement by a dwarf.
</p>
<p><strong>
Cursed. 
</strong>
An item with this keyword carries an effect that is detrimental to the user. Apply this tag only to an item that also requires attunement. A cursed item does not allow you to unattune to it by normal means. Be very careful when designing a cursed item. It’s easy for a powerful curse to make an item unusable, or for an inexperienced designer to put a very light curse on item to justify something that is too powerful.
</p>
<h3>
Common Language
</h3>
<p>
These phrases are often used in item design and will help you to mirror the language that we use on all items we place within the bag.
</p>
<p><strong>
At Will. 
</strong>
When you say that an effect can be used “at will” it means that it can be used as often as the player wants. Be careful when allowing an effect to be used at will.
</p>
<p><strong>
Charges. 
</strong>
When you want to have an item with an effect that can be used a limited number of times, but more than once, use charges. Say that the item contains “x” charges and that each time the effect is used it consumes 1 of those charges.
</p>
<p><strong>
Dawn. 
</strong>
An effect that uses charges or is usable only once per day generally recovers its usage at dawn. Use the following phrases to denote that. “Once used, this property of the item can’t be used again until the next dawn.” or “This item regains all expended charges at dawn.”
</p>
<p><strong>
Action. 
</strong>
If your item has an effect that needs to be activated. Specify what what type of action it takes up. If it's a big effect like casting a spell that would normally take up an action, using the item should probably use an action as well. Use the phrases, “As an action…” “As a bonus action…” or “As a reaction” before describing the effect.
</p>
<p><strong>
+1, +2, +3. 
</strong>
An item with a +x bonus to it adds a flat increase to the items effectiveness. If it’s a weapon that means it gets a bonus to attack and damage rolls for attack made with it. If it’s armor that means that the bonus is applied to its armor class that particular amor gives. It can also be used on ammunition and spellcasting implements.
</p>
<h3>
Balancing Guidelines
</h3>
<p>
The Story, Fable, Myth, and Legend tiers, correspond with the uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary rankings outlined in the Dungeon Masters Guide. Looking at the items within and making comparable items is good way to ensure you’re balancing your items correctly. These simple examples should be helpful guideposts.
</p>
<p><strong>
+1, +2, or +3 weapon or spellcasting focus. 
</strong>
Story, Fable, and Myth tier respectively. Adding additional effects will likely bump the item to the next tier.
</p>
<p><strong>
+1, +2, +3 armor. 
</strong>
Fable, Myth, Legend Tier respectively. Adding additional effects will likely bump the item to the next tier.
</p>
<p><strong>
A level 2, 4, or 6 spell with one use per day. 
</strong>
Story, Fable, Myth respectively. If required, attacks rolls should be around, +5,+7,+9 for those tiers and save DC’s should be around 13, 15, 17.
</p>
<p><strong>
A level 2, 4, or 6 spell with one use per day or a level 1, 3, or 5 spell with 3 uses. 
</strong>
Story, Fable, Myth respectively. If required, attacks rolls should be around, +5,+7,+9 for those tiers and save DC’s should be around 13, 15, 17.
</p><br>
<p>
Many items are not as simple as those listed above. If you have a more unique item idea, consider looking up a spell that would be comparable and using the above chart to gauge how powerful that effect is. Also keep in mind, the numbers above are not absolute and there are many other factors that can influence an item's balance. For example, whether or not it requires attunement and what type of action it uses if any.

Tips and Tricks for a Successful Submission
</h3>
<p>
▪ One of the most important factors in making an interesting item is keeping it simple. Stick to one core idea of what you want your item to do. It’s easy to give an item too many effects and have it become confusing to use.
</p>
<p>
▪ Detail all important aspects of an effect. If your item allows you to do something unique specify how long the effect lasts, the range of the effect, the type of action the effect takes, and how frequently it can be used.
</p>
<p>
▪ Make it unique. Anyone can put a plain +1 sword in the bag. Try and think of items that are different from items you’ve seen pulled so far. We also encourage people to build items that relate to the world. Like a lollipop mace once wielded by a knight from the Big Rock Candy Mountains.
