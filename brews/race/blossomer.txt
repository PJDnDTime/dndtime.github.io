<h2>DnDTime Brews</h2><br>
<h3>Homebrew Race: The Floran (Blossomer)</h3>
<p>
Florans are a species of plantfolk who come in a variety of shapes and sizes and can live for a wide range of years, depending on the subrace. Florans and usually lovers of nature, sometimes becoming adventurers more for the excitement of exploring new places than for any monetary reward. Florans tend towards neutrality, and usually prefer not to engage in the grand conflicts of good versus evil and law versus chaos without provocation. The most common Floran and the Lands of DnDTime fall into the subcategory of Blossomer, Fungal, or Lumberling.
</p>
<p>
Blossomers are lithe and agile plantfolk. Freespirited wanderers of the forest, most Blossomers are naturally in tune with the gentle and innocent aspects of nature. A Blossomer's spirit is one of freedom. Even something as simple as the smell of rich soil on a cool autumn gust can leave a Blossomer in a state of blissful joy.
