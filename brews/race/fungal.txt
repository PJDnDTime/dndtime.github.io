<h3>
Homebrew Race: The Floran (Fungal)
</h3>
<p>
Florans are a race of plantfolk who come in a variety of different shapes and sizes and can live for a wide range of years, depending on the subrace. Florans and usually lovers of nature, sometimes becoming adventurers more for the excitement of exploring new places than for any monetary reward. Florans tend towards neutrality, and usually prefer not to engage in the grand conflicts of good versus evil and law versus chaos without provocation. The most common Floran and the Lands of DnDTime fall into the subcategory of Blossomer, Fungal, or Lumberling.
