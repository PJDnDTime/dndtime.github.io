<h2>The Rules of DnDTime</h2>
<p>We have a few requirements for participating in Pete and Jeremy's DnDTime:
<ul>
<li>Your audio quality must be reasonably clear. Push-to-Talk is strongly encouraged while playing!</li>
<li>When you play, you are expected to interact with the established adventure. Our one-hour adventure format cannot accommodate those who go off on their own to do something unrelated to the adventure.</li>
<li>Be respectful of other players. Rude or hateful behavior will not be tolerated and may result in a ban from DnDTime, at our sole discretion.</li>
<li>You MUST consent to the Legal Agreement in our Player Queue. The agreement serves to protect our content on Youtube, Twitch and other platforms from potential take-down claims.</li>
</ul>
We aim to be an open and friendly community for everyone, so be patient and respectful of newer players. Cursing is acceptable in DnDTime as long as it is not overly excessive or hateful.</p>
<h2>Building a Character</h2>
<p>Once you have posted on our Roll20 Looking For Game posting, we will provide you with a digital character sheet in the staging lobby on Roll20. For those new to Dungeons & Dragons, the following may not make a ton of sense. Feel free to ask for help on our Discord Server, or check out the free <a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules">Basic Rules</a> for guidance.</p>
<p>All DnDTime characters begin at level one. All DnDTime character start with the Standard Array for their ability scores (plus their racial bonuses). Homebrew content is, without exception, disallowed for character creation in DnDTime. The Unearthed Arcana series is also disallowed. Character creation is limited to content from the following published Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition sources: Elemental Evil Player's Companion, Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Volo's Guide to Monsters, Xanathar's Guide to Everything, and The Player's Handbook. Summoning abilities are restricted to summoning no more than one creature at any given time for sake of expediting play. The optional "Feats" rule is disallowed in DnDTime. The optional Multi-Classing rule is also disallowed.</p>
<h2>Character Progression</h2>
<p>Each time you participate in DnDTime, you earn one experience point. For your character to reach the next level, they must accumulate a number of experience points equal to their current level once having reached that level. This formula makes leveling fast early on, but slower at higher levels. In DnDTime, heroes are separated into four tiers based on their character's level: Story, Fable, Myth, and Legend. As a character moves up in tier, they gain access to better items in Bartholomew's Shop, gain a higher salary, and are challenged with more difficult quests. In order to move up a tier, a character must first accumulate the appropriate amount of experience and then complete a boss battle!</p>

<h2>Boss Battles</h2>
<p>Once four heroes have reached the requisite levels of experience, they are sent to battle one of our unique and deadly bosses. A spin on our Wheel of Bosses determines their foe, which range from ferocious dragons to the enigmatic Rhyme Slime. As long as at least one character survives to defeat the boss, everyone in the party is considered to be victorious and gets to share in the spoils of victory. Victory in a boss battle rewards double the normal slary of a character's new tier and a special bonus reward specific to each tier.</p>
<p>Fabled Battles: Our hero is rewarded with a title to be displayed on stream whenever they play. Additionally, NPCs throughout the land of DnDTime have a chance at recognizing characters of Fable Tier status for their accomplishments.</p>
<p>Mythic Battles: No character has progressed far enough to discover the Myth Tier reward yet!</p>
<p>Legendary Battles: No character has progressed far enough to discover the Legend Tier reward yet!</p>
<h2>Quest Failure and Death</h2>
<p>In the world of DnDTime death is a mere inconvenience. If a character dies during an adventure, they are resurrected in Bartholomew's Shop after the adventure. As long as the party succeeds on the quest, the dead character will still gain an equal share of the rewards. If a party fails to complete the quest, they will still earn experience but will not earn any Bartholomew Bucks.</p>
