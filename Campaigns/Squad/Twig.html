				<div class=" statsBlockSubHead"><p>This simple yew twig has a perfect tiny leaf growing from its top. For the purpose of casting spells, the stick functions as a +1 wand. Under the full moon, you may plant the stick in loose soil. By the next dawn, the stick will have magically grown into a staff with many leafy twigs branching from its top. As a bonus action, you may break a twig from the staff, rending the remaining staff inert and returning the item to its wand form.<br><br>This item has 8 charges.<br><br>While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using a spell save DC of 15: Ensnaring Strike (1 charge) or Zephyr Strike (1 charge). This staff can be wielded as a +1 quarterstaff. It deals 1d6 additional bludgeoning damage on a hit when used to make a weapon attack.<br><br>While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using a spell save DC of 15: Find Familiar (1 charge), Animal Messenger (2 charges), Locate Animals or Plants (2 charges), Sympathy (targeting beasts, 5 charges). When using this wand to cast Find Familiar, you do not conjure a new being, but may magically bind a willing beast to your service.<br><br>In either form, you may spend ten minutes, and 8 charges, to perform an elaborate ritual, planting the staff or wand in loose earth and dancing around it. The time needed to cast the ritual is halved for each additional humanoid performing the dance. At the end of the ritual, and as long as the wand or staff remains planted, a the surrounding area becomes magically warded and protected. In a 30 foot radius ring around the staff, a thick wall of fog appears, blocking sight into or out of the area. The fog wall is 10 feet high and 5 feet thick and takes three times as much movement to pass through compared with unimpeded terrain. Within the area, up to four trees of your choice become magically animated, defending the area until they are either destroyed or attackers are repelled. The trees cannot leave the area and when this effect ends, the magic animating them disappears, and the trees take root again if possible. While the staff remains planted, you may determine the weather conditions within the area.<br><br>Each day, at dawn, the item regains 1d6+2 charges.</p></div>
