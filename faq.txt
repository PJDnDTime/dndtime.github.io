<h3>How Do You Play Dungeons & Dragons?</h3>
<p>In <b><u>Pete and Jeremy's DnDTime</u></b> we play Fifth Edition Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). Table top roleplaying games, like D&D, generally focus on three major 'pillars' of game play: exploration, social interaction, and combat. In <b><u>Pete and Jeremy's DnDTime</u></b>, we try to have a bit of each in every one of our games, interesting or silly environments to explore, non-player characters (NPCs) to interact with, and monsters to battle. The best way to get a good grasp on how we run our adventures is to head on over to <a href="https://twitch.tv/dndtime">Twitch.TV</a> and watch a few of our recorded games (or catch us live)!</p>
<p>After that, the <a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules">Basic Rules</a> are a good jumping off point. Although it might seem like a lot to take in, by taking 15 minutes to read through the 'Step-by-Step Character Creation' section in Chapter 1, the 'Using Ability Scores' section in Chapter 7, and the 'Combat' section in Chapter 9, you'll quickly realize that D&D isn't all that complicated. You don't need to know everything to play with us, but you should have at least glanced over and understand the basics of the the system.</p>
