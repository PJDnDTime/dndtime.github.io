Victorious, a nephew of Bartholomew's, spent his youth studying at the Academy of Light. It was his parent's greatest wish that he follow in their footsteps and become a Cleric as they had, but Victorious found the path of a Paladin more suited for a man of his impressive physique, and his somewhat less impressive intellect. He has, despite his change in career path, thrived at the academy, achieving such honors as Prom King, and captain of the ball game team, all while interning with his uncle's adventuring troupe. As Victorious continues forward, he endeavors to show the land of DnDTime what a, "totally righteous dude," he really is.
