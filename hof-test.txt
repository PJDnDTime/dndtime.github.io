	Long ago, a golden Dragonborn was hatched to clan on the brink of a war. A war that they could never have forseen. Demons; The most evil creatures of creatures; Known to ravage and destroy all that might stand before them. On the brink of the demonic onslaught, in an attempt to save the newly hatched dragonborn, the clan sent him on a raft down the nearby river. That hatching was eventually found and brought to a small human orphanage. The Dragonborn known as Kurogan was born on that day.
	<br><br>
	Although never knowing his birth family or clan, he was adopted by a young knight captain. He was raised to follow the teachings of the knight himself. The bravery and acumen of his youth soon grew him into a fierce weapon of war. However, Kurogan was not yet ready when the Demons attacked again. Once more, Kurogan had lost the life and family that he had grown to cherish. Faced with nothing and left with not but the clothes on his back, a weapon, and his loyal retainers and squire, Kurogan set out for new adventures. He found himself in the employ of a powerful wizard with the hopes of finding another place to belong. In that time, he has made many friends and gained both renown and experience. But with destiny thrust upon him, Kurogan's mind lingers on his past - and to the demons that he must one day face again.
