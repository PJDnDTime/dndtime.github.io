Welcome to Pete and Jeremy's DnDTime

</div>
<br><br>
<div class="BodyFont">

We are a Dungeons and Dragons live stream starring you, the viewer!  We air every Friday at 9:00 PM EST on Twitch.TV.  Check out our community Discord server, Twitch.TV channel, Roll20 LFG posting, and social media links below.  We use Discord as our primary means of communication, so check out the #announcements text channel for updates!

About Us

</div>
<br><br>
<div class="BodyFont">

Pete and Jeremy are two average guys who love table top RPGs, like Dungeons & Dragons.  We see tabletop role playing games as a unique medium to explore the process of collaborative storytelling.  We created this show, Pete and Jeremy's DnDTime, because we wanted to share our love for Dungeons & Dragons with our viewers and directly engage them in the storytelling process in a way that conventional live-streams can't.

<br><br><hr><br>

Conventional Dungeons & Dragons live-streams are long-form campaigns with a consistent cast of characters and long-term overarching plots.

<br><br>

DnDTime is not.  Instead, it is made up of three, unrelated, one-hour-long adventures with a cast of players drawn from our audience.  This unique format allows for an unorthodox style of play that promotes creativity, improvisation, and a diverse cast of characters.  The rapidly changing cast and lack of continuity keeps things fresh and allows us to take greater narrative risks in our storytelling.

<br><br><hr><br>

Since we've started the stream, DnDTime has grown into a real community of players and Dungeon Masters who all share a love for Dungeons and Dragons.  We're a friendly and open community, and we sincerely hope that you'll think about being a part of it.

About the Stream

</div>
<br><br>
<div class="BodyFont">

Pete and Jeremy's DnDTime is a Dungeons & Dragons livestream which airs live, every Friday night on Twitch.TV.  The cast of DnDTime consists of 12 guests chosen from our viewers.  These guests play characters of their creation in three, one-hour long mini-adventures which take place over the course of the night.  There is no overarching plot or story-line connecting adventures, however there are recurring characters and settings which provide a framework for adventures in the world of DnDtime. 

<br><br>

The most significant of these is Bartholomew, the Grand Wizard.  Bartholomew provides our heroes with exciting quests, steady pay, and also runs the in-game shop where players buy fun magical items.  In DnDTime, groups of heroes are assigned quests by Bartholomew in exchange for a magical currency called Bartholomew Bucks.  As heroes complete their quests, their renown and skill grows, as does their salary.

<br><br>

Other recurring non-player characters and locations recurr frequently and separate DnDTime from unbridled, improvisational chaos.  A hero may visit the Great Dump ruled by the mysterious and aloof "Trash King", become embroiled in the ancient conflict between the Math Goblins and the Trigognomes, or perhaps journey deep into the Baradac Swamp where anthropomorphic frogs and untold evils hold dominion.  These common locations and characters give a solid grounding for viewers to recognize despite our ever-changing cast of heroes.

Joining DnDTime

</div>
<br><br>
<div class="BodyFont">

DnDTime is just about as relaxed and low-commitment as you can get in the world of Dungeons & Dragons;  Because our adventures are non-continuous, there is no commitment from week to week.  To apply to joing DnDTime, head over to our Player Queue page, make comment on our Roll20 Looking For Game posting, and stop by our Discord Server and drop @DM Jeremy and @DM Pete a message!

<br><br>

Speaking of which, Roll20 is what is called a "Table Top Simulator".  It is a virual interface where players can control tokens (representing your characters and the enemies) and roll dice.  We only use Roll20 to roll dice and track character abilities.  Once you've posted on our Looking For Game posting, we can help you figure out Roll20 on the Discord Server.  Despite the prevalence of other table top tools, such as DnDBeyond, we require that players use the Roll20 built in character sheet as it speeds up dice rolling and allows us to easily review players' character sheets.

<br><br>

We use two different Roll20 lobbies for this game. The lobby you'll join initially is our staging area where you can build and test your character. Once its your turn to play in DnDTime we will provide a link to our live game lobby. This way you can update your character sheets, test your rolls, and chat in the staging lobby, without interrupting the stream.  Always make sure to update your character sheet in the staging lobby, not the live game.
If you want to use Roll20's macro functionality, refrain from creating macros which is not self-contained within your character sheet, as they will not carry over with the lobby transfer.

<br><br>

There are getting to be a lot of people interested in playing in DnDtime, and there will be weeks where we don't have enough room for everyone to fit into a game, so make sure to follow the instructions on our Player Queue web page!

The Rules of DnDTime

</div>
<br><br>
<div class="BodyFont">

We have a few requirements for participating in Pete and Jeremy's DnDTime:

<ul>
<li>Your audio quality must be reasonably clear. Push-to-Talk is strongly encouraged while playing!</li>
<li>When you play, you are expected to interact with the established adventure.  Our one-hour adventure format cannot accommodate those who go off on their own to do something unrelated to the adventure.</li>
<li>Be respectful of other players. Rude or hateful behavior will not be tolerated and may result in a ban from DnDTime, at our sole discretion.</li>
<li>You MUST consent to the Legal Agreement in our Player Queue.  The agreement serves to protect our content on Youtube, Twitch and other platforms from potential take-down claims.</li>
</ul>

We aim to be an open and friendly community for everyone, so be patient and respectful of newer players. Cursing is acceptable in DnDTime as long as it is not overly excessive or hateful.

Building a Character

</div>
<br><br>
<div class="BodyFont">

Once you have posted on our Roll20 Looking For Game posting, we will provide you with a digital character sheet in the staging lobby on Roll20.  For those new to Dungeons & Dragons, the following may not make a ton of sense. Feel free to ask for help on our Discord Server, or check out the free <a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules">Basic Rules</a> for guidance.

<br><br>

All DnDTime characters begin at level one.  All DnDTime character start with the Standard Array for their ability scores (plus their racial bonuses).  Homebrew content is, without exception, disallowed for character creation in DnDTime.  The Unearthed Arcana series is also disallowed.  Character creation is limited to content from the following published Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition sources: Elemental Evil Player's Companion, Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Volo's Guide to Monsters, Xanathar's Guide to Everything, and The Player's Handbook.  Summoning abilities are restricted to summoning no more than one creature at any given time for sake of expediting play.  The optional "Feats" rule is disallowed in DnDTime. The optional Multi-Classing rule is also disallowed.

</div>
<br><hr><br>
<div class="HeadFont">

Character Progression

</div>
<br><br>
<div class="BodyFont">

Each time you participate in DnDTime, you earn one experience point.  For your character to reach the next level, they must accumulate a number of experience points equal to their current level once having reached that level.  This formula makes leveling fast early on, but slower at higher levels.  In DnDTime, heroes are separated into four tiers based on their character's level: Story, Fable, Myth, and Legend.  As a character moves up in tier, they gain access to better items in Bartholomew's Shop, gain a higher salary, and are challenged with more difficult quests.  In order to move up a tier, a character must first accumulate the appropriate amount of experience and then complete a boss battle!

Boss Battles

</div>
<br><br>
<div class="BodyFont">

Once four heroes have reached the requisite levels of experience, they are sent to battle one of our unique and deadly bosses.  A spin on our Wheel of Bosses determines their foe, which range from ferocious dragons to the enigmatic Rhyme Slime.  As long as at least one character survives to defeat the boss, everyone in the party is considered to be victorious and gets to share in the spoils of victory.  Victory in a boss battle rewards double the normal slary of a character's new tier and a special bonus reward specific to each tier.

<br><br>

Fabled Battles: Our hero is rewarded with a title to be displayed on stream whenever they play.  Additionally, NPCs throughout the land of DnDTime have a chance at recognizing characters of Fable Tier status for their accomplishments.

<br><br>

Mythic Battles: No character has progressed far enough to discover the Myth Tier reward yet!

<br><br>

Legendary Battles: No character has progressed far enough to discover the Legend Tier reward yet!

<br><br>

<div class="HeadFont">

Quest Failure and Death

</div>
<br><br>
<div class="BodyFont">

In the world of DnDTime death is a mere inconvenience.  If a character dies during an adventure, they are resurrected in Bartholomew's Shop after the adventure. As long as the party succeeds on the quest, the dead character will still gain an equal share of the rewards.  If a party fails to complete the quest, they will still earn experience but will not earn any Bartholomew Bucks.

Player Queue

</div>
<br><br>
<div class="BodyFont">

Register below for this week's episode of DnDTime.  This queue will be open every week from Monday through Wednesday.  On Thursday, the queue will close and we will contact the top twelve players in the queue who have the highest priorities and confirm their participation in Friday's games.  These players will be contacted via direct message on our Discord Server.  The first game each week will prioritize new players.  Players gain priority for every cumulative hour having watched the stream which is tracked via bot.  Each time a player participates in DnDTime, their priority decreases slightly.

<br><br>

The queue resets weekly, so remember to enter each week that you are interested in playing!

<br><br>

Flagrant attempts to abuse our system will result in disqualification from participating in DnDTime.

Bartholomew's Big Bag Bonanza

</div>
<br>
<div class="BodyFont">

Throughout countless years of adventuring, Bartholomew's personal Bag of Holding has become quite the managerie of magical curios.  For a price, you may reach into the bag and pull a random magic item from within.  Bartholomew has used this bag for just about everything throughout his career, so you may find legendary weapons the likes of Zhjivjals, a blade forged of pure shadow by the legendary spirit smiths of Ysyk'Tor!... Or if luck is not on your side, you might just end up with Bartholomew's lunch.  The Big Bag Bonanza houses hundreds of unique magical items, so try your luck today!  Prices are shown below.  You may not buy a pull from the bag above your adventuring tier.

Generally speaking, if you roll a 1, something terrible will happen.  If you roll below a 10, you'll get some non-magical garbage like Bartholomew's Lunch.  If you roll between an 11 and 25, you'll get some unimpressive minor magical item.  If you roll between a 26 and 75, you'll get a random magical consumable. Between 75 and 300, lie items fit for a Storied Hero. Between 301 and 600 lie items fit for a Fabled Hero. Between 601 and 900 lie items fit for a Mythic Hero.  Above 900 lies legendary items of great and terrible power.

Gameshow Time

</div>
<br>
<div class="BodyFont">

In an effort to make some extra money on the side, Bartholomew has decided to turn his shop into an exciting opt-in Gameshow!  Whenever a player decides to purchase a pull from Bartholomew's Big Bag Bonanza, they get the opportunity to participate in one of the exciting activities below to recieve an discount on their purchase.  Limit: One game per visit.

<br><br>

<b>You Time</b> -  You take the stage!  You have one minute to talk about your character(s), their backstories, their adventures, expiences, opinions, or just about whatever you want!  You get a 25 Bartholomew Buck discount on your purchase for participating.

<br><br>

<b>Trivia Time</b> - Answer a trivia question about DnDTime's characters, adventures, or lore.  Guess correctly for a 50 Bartholomew Buck discount on your purchase.

<br><br>

<b>Trash Time</b> - End up with a magic item you don't like? Toss it back here! You either be guaranteed one third of the item's value back (based on the items tier: Story, Fable, Myth, etc.) or can choose to roll and see if you get lucky! If choosing to roll, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, you get nothing back and lose the item, on a roll of 20, you get to pull from the bag for free and you keep the trash for next time!

Enchantments, Upgrades, and Glamour

</div>

<div class="BodyFont">

One of the many magical services that Bartholomew offers is to magically enhance your equipment.  For a fee, your existing armor can be transmuted into armor of higher effectiveness.

<b>Glamour</b> - Bartholomew also wields the power to magically 'glamour' your gear.  For 100 Bartholomew Bucks, you can have your armor or weapons magically transmuted to visually appear however you so choose.  Changes can include illusory effects, color style, accessories, etc.  Glamouring an item makes it magical, but does not provide any inherent bonus to effectiveness;  For example, a glamoured flaming sword only appears to be on fire and does not actually do any fire damage.  No amount of glamouring will confound the discerning eye;  No matter what you make your item look like, it will always be recognized for what it is (you can't make a sword look like a walking stick for example).  If you choose to glamour an item and wish its appearance to show up on the Item Codex, Direct Message @DM Jeremy on Discord with a description of your glamour.

<br><br>

<b>Enchantment</b> - Of course, Bartholomew is a <u>very</u> powerful wizard, so he can enchant items to be more effective as well. For 400 Bartholomew Bucks, you can have your weapon transformed into a “+1” magical weapon.  This weapon would provide you with a +1 bonus to your attack rolls, and damage rolls (including spell attacks).  This enchantment comes with glamour for free, and costs 100 Bartholomew Bucks less if your items are already glamoured.

		<br>
		One command word causes the box to unfold into a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep. The boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. The boat can hold up to four Medium creatures comfortably.
		<br>
		The second command word causes the box to unfold into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide; and 6 feet deep. The ship has a deck, rowing seats, five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The ship can hold fifteen Medium creatures comfortably.
		<br>
		When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.
		<br>
		The third command word causes the folding boat to fold back into a box, provided that no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that can't fit inside the box remain outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so.

Bartholomew's Choice

</div>
<br>
<div class="BodyFont">

Little known fact, Bartholomew loves money.  Rumor has it that if you give him a big enough pile of it (lets say 5,000 Bartholomew Bucks) and provide him a sentimental item which is special to your character, he will use his near-limitless magic to transform the item into a legendary artifact of awesome power...

The Back Room...

</div>
<br>
<div class="BodyFont">

A large iron door stands, somewhat out of place, against the back wall of Bartholomew's Shop. Chains wrap around it, sealing it shut.  Behind it is rumored to lie the most dangerous artifacts known to man.  Artifacts of untold power and wonder.  Some say that Bartholomew might be willing to let a powerful enough hero inside to look around... for a price.

How Do You Play Dungeons & Dragons?

</div>
<br>
<div class="BodyFont">

First of all, we're stoked that you decided to play some of your first games of Dungeons and Dragons (D&D or DnD) with us!

After that, check out the <a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules">Fifth Edition Free Basic Rules</a>.  It might seem like a lot to take in, but by taking 15 or 20 minutes to read the 'Step-by-Step Character Creation' section in Chapter 1, the 'Using Ability Scores' section in Chapter 7, and the 'Combat' section in Chapter 9, you'll quickly realize that D&D is easy to play!  Check out our 'Playing in DnDTime' webpage. If you have trouble figuring things out, stop by our Discord Server and Pete, Jeremy, or one of the many friendly community members of DnDTime will be glad to help you out!
