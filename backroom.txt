<h2>The Back Room</h2>
<p>An solid iron door rises, somewhat out of place, against the empty back wall of Bartholomew's Shop. Animated chains wrap around it, sealing it shut to all but the most powerful of Bartholomew's adventurers. Beyond this iron portal lies the most dangerous artifacts in existence; Artifacts of unfathomable power and unimaginable wonder. It is told that Bartholomew may even be willing to part with these cataclysmic items... for a price.</p>
<h3>The Sword</h3>
<p>As the iron door creaks open, it takes you a moment to acclimate to the utter darkness of the room beyond, but the violent rattling of chains beyond cannot be missed. At the far wall, a sword lurches violently towards you, bound more or less in place by thick black chains. The blade shakes and quivers straining against its restraints. In that instant, two of the chain links burst and the sword begins to fly forward, freed, but just as quickly, the chains repair themselves, once again pulling the blade back against the wall.</p>
<p>The blade itself glows brightly, refracting golden light about the room in irregular patterns caused by inconsistencies in the blade's steel. Inconsistencies of a blade that has been broken and reforged many times. The obsidian cross-guard curves out and upward like a wicked grin, and in the pommel, a brilliant ruby gleams with the fire of the sun.</p>
<h3>The Door</h3>
<p>Leaning unceremoniously against the right wall of the back room is a simple rectangular wooden door. It appears to be made of a simple dark oak, and like most everything in the Back Room, is coated in a heavy layer of dust. The handle is a tarnished brass and a gleaming silver skeleton key sits in the door's lock. Approach the door, you hear a muffled sound, as if emanating from just the other side. The pounding of war drums; A gentle lapping of waves; A roar of flame. Sound after sound emanates from the door, never repeating and never louder than a whisper.</p>
<h3>The Tome</h3>
<p>Beneath a think layer of dust, on a shelf along the back room's left wall, rests a red, leather-bound book. The faint scent of freshly printed parchment hangs in the air, but the symbols along the book's binding are of no language that your, nor any living being, has ever known. As you stare at the book, your mind begins to spin and the book's boundless mysteries begin to creep into your every thought. The book exudes an aura of unnameable existential dread.</p>
<h3>The Seed</h3>
<p>On the shelf alongside The Tome, sits a peculiar object, a massive seed. It is a rich taupe color overpowers the thick layer of dust which rests upon it; Streaks of vibrant green run through and across the seed like veins. A light bioluminescent shimmer darts, on occasion, along these lines as if they were roads. As you place your hands upon the seed, you feel your heartbeat slow to a crawl, matching the ancient rhythmic pounding that reverberates from within.</p>
<h3>The Cloak</h3>
<p>From a brass coat-rack in the near right corner of the Back Room hangs a white cloak. The cloak is ineffably white, the purity of its weave unmolested by dust or age; It appears that even shadows dare not fall upon The Cloak. As you reach out your hand and run it over the material, you find it to be perfectly rigid, yet softer than silk. No matter the force or magic you muster, The Cloak stays precisely in place. There is a well-defined circle upon the floor and walls around the cloak that is completely free from dust.</p>
<h3>The Hidden</h3>
<p>Resting upon a table on the right side of the room isâ€¦ something. Whatever it is, Bartholomew has deemed it necessary to cover it with a cloth-like weave of impossibly fine adamantine chain, which is, in its own right, covered in dust. The object beneath seems to be about a foot tall and is vaguely cylindrical. As you peer at it you find your mind beginning to wander. Although still conscious and aware, a particular memory is suddenly made fresh and has taken up the forefront of your thought. The memory of a single moment in your life, in which you were truly happy. The memory lingers as you stare at The Hidden, but as you eventually look away, it fades with a chill, and you are left feeling hollow.</p>
<h3>The Ring</h3>
<p>A plain wooden band rests upon the left wall shelf. That is at least how Bartholomew perceives it, but as he soon describes, the ring has held as many appearances as there are people whom have seen it. To one the ring was a tiny coiled snake that hissed and wriggled, to another an ever burning circle of heat-less flame. All which remains consistent is it's circular shape, and the intense longing for it that all who gaze upon it feel. It is at this moment that you feel a strong hand grasp your forearm. Reality snaps into focus, your hand mere inches from the ring, and Bartholomew gravely standing alongside you, holding you back. The Ring's desire dulled with a wave of Bartholomew's hand.</p>
<h3>The Lens</h3>
<p>The final object resting upon the left wall's shelf is small and coin-shaped, coated in dust. A brush of your hand reveals a small golden monocle. Crafted with a level of detail achievable by mortals, the lens exudes a divine, yet unsettling, aura. Fine mechanisms along its sides seem to switch smaller lenses in and out to alter the way light filters view through the main lens. As you peer through the glass of the lens you see beyond another place outside of this room. A place filled with stars, with wondrous constructions, with color, and with light. This glimmering vision lasts a mere moment, before a pale hand reaches out and covers the lens from the other side and the vision goes black.</p>
