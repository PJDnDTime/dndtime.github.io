<h3 style="margin-top:0px !important;">Lance Silverblood, the Silver Heirophant</h3>
<p>
Lance was brought up under the care of Laurus Nejem, a priest of Selune, in a small abbey north of Central City. The young Lance was wretched, distant, and scorched, yet with time he slowly came back to the world from the mental prison that held him. Lance was hungry for knowledge, and he studied diligently. It wasn’t long before he overtook his peers, and in many cases, his teachers. Soon he had become quite the respected Cleric in his own right, and he received permission to lend clerical aid to Bartholomew’s adventuring troupe.
</p><p>
Though he speaks little of it, the events of Lance’s childhood have remained his main driving force. For when he was but a child, his home village of druids was attacked by a dragon. What could fight such a beast but the Gods? Despite having become an accomplished cleric and despite having gained many mighty friends, this foe still holds the peace of Lance hostage by his existence alone. Lance seeks to heal this deep emotional scar in time, and with the aid of his new friends.

If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from Lance as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of him. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. When an undead of CR 1/2 or lower fails its saving throw, the creature is instantly destroyed.
