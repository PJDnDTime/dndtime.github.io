<h3 style="margin-top:0px !important;">Sylias Galanodel, Judge Switch</h3>
<p>
Switch, the oldest of 12 sons and daughters of a pirate king spent her youth attempting to gain power from when she was still a preteen, and that quest for dominance is what drives her to this very day, she seeks to prove her might over others in strength and will. Never tolerating cowardice or fear she drives forward constantly in order to achieve her goals and keep to her bargains with those who give coin to word. She is influenced by the words of the devourer, a creature not fully understood, whispering in to her head during her sleep, giving her powers mere mortals could not wield.
</p><p>
She has a fondness for monstrosities that most adventurers would find repulsive or intolerable such as remorhaz, banderhobb, etc. choosing to befriend these monsters when she can. Before she joined Bartholomew's band she had just finished overthrowing a kingdom built upon slavery and thieves, a barbaric king and his corrupt seer wife met their fate at the hands of switch, who during the battle was wounded. Her adventures with Bartholomew's band have since brought her back to her former glory, but now she seeks more power. Do you dare attempt to stop her?
