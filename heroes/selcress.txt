<h3 style="margin-top:0px !important;">Selcress, of the Frozen Crown</h3>
<p>
Selcress of the Frozen Crown was originally Selcress of House Ishal, a noble drow household in the Underdark. Her mother was a high priestess of Lolth by the name of Larshalee. Her father, a drow, warped and twisted by a demonic ritual. Her upbringing instilled in her a sense of complete and total superiority over all other beings. The only thing she believed capable of threatening her were other Drow households. After making a childish blunder which put the standing of her house in jeopardy, Selcress refused to disappoint her mother by telling her.  Instead, she sought help from a darker power, Levistus the Ice Prince of Stygia.
</p><p>
After receiving her power for a hefty price, Selcress dealt with their competitor on her own.  Still longing for her mother's approval, Selcress went ahead and joined Bartholomew's band of adventurers to gain both her mother's recognition and more peons for their conquest.  Eventually, she surpassed her mother in the ranks of the adventurers, growing ever stronger and showcasing her superiority.  She has it all, the power, the peons, and her mother's respect, but Selcressâ€™ eyes turn to ever greater heights.
