<p>Reaching the mythic tier of adventuring is no small feat; Each of these heroes have battled through over 21 adventures and faced the toughest challenges that <strong>Pete & Jeremy's DnDTime</strong> has yet to offerâ€¦</p>

<p>Have these heroes truly reached the pinnacle?</p>
<p>Or have they only just opened the door, to greatness.</p>
