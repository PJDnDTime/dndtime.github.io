        Got unlucky and don't like the item you've pulled from Bartholomew's Shop? Post it for sale or trade here, at the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeC80ARQ3Kg8YW1mNh1IzUcq9PnTh75Ga3cwuufmSfjgHyDdA/viewform?usp=sf_link">Pete & Jeremy's DnDTime Trading Post</a>! Check out all items up for trade from other players. Once you've found an item you want, get in touch with the seller on Discord and then both of you can contact Pete or Jeremy with a confirmation of the trade.
