<h2>About DnDTime</h2>
<p>Pete and Jeremy's DnDTime is a Dungeons & Dragons livestream which airs live, every Friday night on Twitch.TV. The cast of DnDTime consists of 12 guests chosen from our viewers. These guests play characters of their creation in three, one-hour long mini-adventures which take place over the course of the night. There is no overarching plot or story-line connecting adventures, however there are recurring characters and settings which provide a framework for adventures in the world of DnDtime.</p>
<p>The most significant of these is Bartholomew, the Grand Wizard. Bartholomew provides our heroes with exciting quests, steady pay, and also runs the in-game shop where players buy fun magical items. In DnDTime, groups of heroes are assigned quests by Bartholomew in exchange for a magical currency called Bartholomew Bucks. As heroes complete their quests, their renown and skill grows, as does their salary.</p>
<p>Other recurring non-player characters and locations recurr frequently and separate DnDTime from unbridled, improvisational chaos. A hero may visit the Great Dump ruled by the mysterious and aloof "Trash King", become embroiled in the ancient conflict between the Math Goblins and the Trigognomes, or perhaps journey deep into the Baradac Swamp where anthropomorphic frogs and untold evils hold dominion. These common locations and characters give a solid grounding for viewers to recognize despite our ever-changing cast of heroes.</p>
