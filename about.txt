<h2>About DnDTime</h2>
<p>
DnDTime is a Twitch.tv channel and Discord community dedicated to 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). Pete and Jeremy started this channel because we have a passion for D&D and want to share that passion with the world. We broadcast quite a few differents shows on Twitch, but our premier show is <strong>Pete & Jeremy's DnDTime</strong>. The short-form episodic nature of <strong>Pete & Jeremy's DnDTime</strong> affords us the creative liberty to really take some creative risks and be outside the box with our adventures, locations, and NPCs. For us, being a Dungeon Master is about making something interesting, unique, and engaging for our players.

<strong>Pete & Jeremy's DnDTime</strong> has been running for over a year now, and Pete and Jeremy could not be more proud of the community and the game we've all built together.

<h2>About Pete & Jeremy</h2><br>
<h3>TrustAFlumph (DnDTime Jeremy)</h3>
<p>
Jeremy has a degree in chemical engineering and graduated from the University of Massachussetts, Amherst in 2015. Jeremy's first real exposure to D&D was in 2006 playing Pathfinder; However he, alongside his local gaming group, swapped to 4th Edition upon its release in 2008. Despite the relatively strong sentiment in the D&D community against 4th Edition D&D, Jeremy loves the nitty gritty tactics and encounter/daily power system of 4th Edition to this day. Jeremy was extremely tentative about D&D Next, which later became 5th Edition D&D, initially distrusting, but eventually falling in love with, the branching-tree character choices design of the system. Jeremy has played a hand full of other table top RPG systems, such as Stars Without Number, B.E.S.M., Paranoia, and several experimental free-form table-top systems of his own creation throughout his experience in table-top gaming.
