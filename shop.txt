<h3>Bartholomew's Big Bag Bonanza</h3>
<p>
The signature option at Bartholomew's Shop. Throughout countless years of adventuring, Bartholomew's personal Bag of Holding has become quite the menagerie of magical curios. For a price, you may reach into the bag and pull a random magical item from within. This bag has been used for just about everything; You may find the legendary weapon Zhjivjals, a blade forged of pure shadow by the legendary spirit smiths of Ysyk'Tor!… Or if luck is not on your side, you might just end up with Bartholomew's lunch. The Big Bag Bonanza houses hundreds of unique magical items, so try your luck!

Enchantment.
</b> 
Bartholomew's power, of course, extends beyond mere style. For 400 <span class="bucks">฿฿</span>, your weapon or spellcasting focus can be transformed into a <strong>+1</strong> magical item, providing a +1 bonus to your attack rolls, and damage rolls (including spell attacks) made using the item. When you enchant an item, you get a glamour for free; If an item is already glamoured, the cost of enchanting the item is reduced by 100 <span class="bucks">฿฿</span>.
</p>
<p><strong>
Glamour.
</strong> 
Bartholomew also wields the power to magically style your equipment. For 100 <span class="bucks">฿฿</span>, the physical appearance of your armor or weapons can be transmuted to your preference. This process, called glamour, may include illusory effects, colors, or accessories. A glamoured item is magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance to nonmagical damage, but doesn't gain any other bonus to effectiveness; For example, a sword glamoured to appear on fire would not do any additional fire damage. Additionally, no matter what your item looks like a glamoured item's nature cannot be concealed (i.e. a wizard's staff made to look like a simple walking stick, will still be recognized as a staff).
</p>
<h3>Potions and Other Consumables</h3>
<p><strong>
Potions.</strong> 
Potions of healing can be used to restore hit points (HP) during an adventure and come in a limitless variety of flavors. Some favorites include Cherry, Coffee, and Vanilla, however Bartholomew's favorites tend to be more abstract like Enthusiasm or Taxes.<br>A silght deviation from the normal rules of 5th Edition D&D, in <strong>Pete & Jeremy's DnDTime</strong> drinking a potion takes a bonus action, while feeding a potion to an unconscious ally takes an action.

Wizardly Tutoring.
</strong> 
Bartholomew, being a very powerful wizard, knows every spell in existance. For a fee of 50 <span class="bucks">฿฿</span> per spell level, a character of the wizard class can purchase a scroll detailing the arcane secrets of a wizard spell of their choosing. Once read, this scroll magically imparts the knowledge of the spell in their mind and adds it to their spellbook. A wizard must still follow the usual rules for preparing spells.
</p>
<h3>The Display Case</h3>

During this time, the robe sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Creatures that can see you have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. In addition, any creature in the bright light that can see you when the robe's power is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become stunned until the effect ends.

<h3>Bartholomew's Choice</h3>
<p>
Little known fact, Bartholomew loves money. Rumor has it that if you give him a big enough pile of it (lets say 5,000 <span class="bucks">฿฿</span>), he will use his near-limitless magic to craft for you a legendary artifact of awesome power.
