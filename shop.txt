<h3>Bartholomew's Big Bag Bonanza</h3>

For a price, you may reach into the bag and pull a random magical item from within. This bag has been used for just about everything; You may find the legendary weapon Zhjivjals, a blade forged of pure shadow by the legendary spirit smiths of Ysyk'Tor!… Or if luck is not on your side, you might just end up with Bartholomew's lunch. The Big Bag Bonanza houses hundreds of unique magical items, so try your luck!

Enchantment.
</b> 
Bartholomew's power, of course, extends beyond mere style. For 400 <span class="bucks">฿฿</span>, your weapon or spellcasting focus can be transformed into a <strong>+1</strong> magical item, providing a +1 bonus to your attack rolls, and damage rolls (including spell attacks) made using the item. When you enchant an item, you get a glamour for free; If an item is already glamoured, the cost of enchanting the item is reduced by 100 <span class="bucks">฿฿</span>.
</p>
<p><strong>
Glamour.
</strong> 
Bartholomew also wields the power to magically style your equipment. For 100 <span class="bucks">฿฿</span>, the physical appearance of your armor or weapons can be transmuted to your preference. This process, called glamour, may include illusory effects, colors, or accessories. A glamoured item is magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance to nonmagical damage, but does gain any other bonus to effectiveness; For example, a sword glamoured to appear on fire would not do any additional fire damage. Additionally, no matter what your item looks like a glamoured item's nature cannot be concealed (i.e. a wizard's staff made to look like a simple walking stick, will still be recognized as a staff).
</p>
<h3>Potions and Other Consumables</h3>
<p><strong>
Potions.</strong> 
Potions of healing can be used to restore hit points (HP) during an adventure and come in an limitless variety of flavors. Some favorites include Cherry, Coffee, and Vanilla, however Bartholomew's favorites tend to be more abstract like Enthusiasm or Taxes.<br>A silght deviation from the normal rules of 5th Edition D&D, in <strong><u>Pete & Jeremy's DnDTime</strong></u> drinking a potion takes a bonus action, while feeding a potion to an unconscious ally takes an action.

Wizardly Tutoring.
</strong> 
Bartholomew, being a very powerful wizard, knows every spell in existance. For a fee of 50 <span class="bucks">฿฿</span> per spell level, a character of the wizard class can purchase a scroll detailing the arcane secrets of a wizard spell of their choosing. Once read, this scroll magically imparts the knowledge of the spell in their mind and adds it to their spellbook. A wizard must still follow the usual rules for preparing spells.

<h3>The Display Case</h3>

Cap of Water Breathing
</th>
<td>
While wearing this cap underwater, you can speak its command word as an action to create a bubble of air around your head. It allows you to breathe normally underwater. This bubble stays with you until you speak the command word again, the cap is removed, or you are no longer underwater.

Helm of Telepathy
</th><td>
Requires Attunement. While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the detect thoughts spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply — using a bonus action to do so — while your focus on it continues.<br>
While focusing on a creature with detect thoughts, you can use an action to cast the suggestion spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the suggestion property can't be used again until the next dawn.

Flame Tongue
</th><td>
Requires Attunement. You can use a bonus action to speak this magic sword' command word, causing flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword.

<h3>Bartholomew's Choice</h3>
<p>
Little known fact, Bartholomew loves money. Rumor has it that if you give him a big enough pile of it (lets say 5,000 <span class="bucks">฿฿</span>), he will use his near-limitless magic to craft for you a legendary artifact of awesome power.
