Bartholomew's Big Bag Bonanza

</div>
<br>
<div class="BodyFont">

Throughout countless years of adventuring, Bartholomew's personal Bag of Holding has become quite the managerie of magical curios.  For a price, you may reach into the bag and pull a random magic item from within.  Bartholomew has used this bag for just about everything throughout his career, so you may find legendary weapons the likes of Zhjivjals, a blade forged of pure shadow by the legendary spirit smiths of Ysyk'Tor!... Or if luck is not on your side, you might just end up with Bartholomew's lunch.  The Big Bag Bonanza houses hundreds of unique magical items, so try your luck today!  Prices are shown below.  You may not buy a pull from the bag above your adventuring tier.

Generally speaking, if you roll a 1, something terrible will happen.  If you roll below a 10, you'll get some non-magical garbage like Bartholomew's Lunch.  If you roll between an 11 and 25, you'll get some unimpressive minor magical item.  If you roll between a 26 and 75, you'll get a random magical consumable. Between 75 and 300, lie items fit for a Storied Hero. Between 301 and 600 lie items fit for a Fabled Hero. Between 601 and 900 lie items fit for a Mythic Hero.  Above 900 lies legendary items of great and terrible power.

Gameshow Time

</div>
<br>
<div class="BodyFont">

Whenever a player decides to purchase a pull from Bartholomew's Big Bag Bonanza, they get the opportunity to participate in one of the exciting activities below to recieve an discount on their purchase.  Limit: One game per visit.

<br><br>

<b>You Time</b> -  You take the stage!  You have one minute to talk about your character(s), their backstories, their adventures, expiences, opinions, or just about whatever you want!  You get a 25 Bartholomew Buck discount on your purchase for participating.

<br><br>

<b>Trivia Time</b> - Answer a trivia question about DnDTime's characters, adventures, or lore.  Guess correctly for a 50 Bartholomew Buck discount on your purchase.

Enchantments, Upgrades, and Glamour

</div>
<br>
<div class="BodyFont">

One of the many magical services that Bartholomew offers is to magically enhance your equipment.  For a fee, your existing armor can be transmuted into armor of higher effectiveness.

<br><br>

<b>Glamour</b> - Bartholomew also wields the power to magically 'glamour' your gear.  For 100 Bartholomew Bucks, you can have your armor or weapons magically transmuted to visually appear however you so choose.  Changes can include illusory effects, color style, accessories, etc.  Glamouring an item makes it magical, but does not provide any inherent bonus to effectiveness;  For example, a glamoured flaming sword only appears to be on fire and does not actually do any fire damage.  No amount of glamouring will confound the discerning eye;  No matter what you make your item look like, it will always be recognized for what it is (you can't make a sword look like a walking stick for example).  If you choose to glamour an item and wish its appearance to show up on the Item Codex, Direct Message @DM Jeremy on Discord with a description of your glamour.

<br><br>

<b>Enchantment</b> - Of course, Bartholomew is a <u>very</u> powerful wizard, so he can enchant items to be more effective as well. For 400 Bartholomew Bucks, you can have your weapon transformed into a “+1” magical weapon.  This weapon would provide you with a +1 bonus to your attack rolls, and damage rolls (including spell attacks).  This enchantment comes with glamour for free, and costs 100 Bartholomew Bucks less if your items are already glamoured.

		You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit an undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.
		<br>
		The sword's luminous blade emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight.

Bartholomew's Choice

</div>
<br>
<div class="BodyFont">

Little known fact, Bartholomew loves money.  Rumor has it that if you give him a big enough pile of it (lets say 5,000 Bartholomew Bucks) and provide him a sentimental item which is special to your character, he will use his near-limitless magic to transform the item into a legendary artifact of awesome power...

The Back Room...

</div>
<br>
<div class="BodyFont">

A large iron door stands, somewhat out of place, against the back wall of Bartholomew's Shop. Chains wrap around it, sealing it shut.  Behind it is rumored to lie the most dangerous artifacts known to man.  Artifacts of untold power and wonder.  Some say that Bartholomew might be willing to let a powerful enough hero inside to look around... for a price.

First of all, we're stoked that you decided to play some of your first games of Dungeons and Dragons (D&D or DnD) with us!

After that, check out the <a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules">Fifth Edition Free Basic Rules</a>.  It might seem like a lot to take in, but by taking 15 or 20 minutes to read the 'Step-by-Step Character Creation' section in Chapter 1, the 'Using Ability Scores' section in Chapter 7, and the 'Combat' section in Chapter 9, you'll quickly realize that D&D is easy to play!  Check out our 'Playing in DnDTime' webpage.
