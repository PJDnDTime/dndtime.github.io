	About Us
</div><br>
<br>
<div class="BodyFont">
	Pete and Jeremy are two average guys who love table top RPGs, like Dungeons & Dragons. We see tabletop role playing games as a unique medium to explore the process of collaborative storytelling. We created this show, Pete and Jeremy's DnDTime, because we wanted to share our love for Dungeons & Dragons with our viewers and directly engage them in the storytelling process in a way that conventional live-streams can't.<br>
	<br>
	<hr>
	<br>
	Conventional Dungeons & Dragons live-streams are long-form campaigns with a consistent cast of characters and long-term overarching plots.<br>
	<br>
	DnDTime is not. Instead, it is made up of three, unrelated, one-hour-long adventures with a cast of players drawn from our audience. This unique format allows for an unorthodox style of play that promotes creativity, improvisation, and a diverse cast of characters. The rapidly changing cast and lack of continuity keeps things fresh and allows us to take greater narrative risks in our storytelling.<br>
	<br>
	<hr>
	<br>
	Since we've started the stream, DnDTime has grown into a real community of players and Dungeon Masters who all share a love for Dungeons and Dragons. We're a friendly and open community, and we sincerely hope that you'll think about being a part of it.
