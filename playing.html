About the Stream

</div>
<br><br>
<div class="BodyFont">

Pete and Jeremy's DnDTime is a Dungeons & Dragons livestream which airs live, every Friday night on Twitch.TV.  The cast of DnDTime consists of 12 guests chosen from our viewers.  These guests play characters of their creation in three, one-hour long mini-adventures which take place over the course of the night.  There is no overarching plot or story-line connecting adventures, however there are recurring characters and settings which provide a framework for adventures in the world of DnDtime. 

<br><br>

The most significant of these is Bartholomew, the Grand Wizard.  Bartholomew provides our heroes with exciting quests, steady pay, and also runs the in-game shop where players buy fun magical items.  In DnDTime, groups of heroes are assigned quests by Bartholomew in exchange for a magical currency called Bartholomew Bucks.  As heroes complete their quests, their renown and skill grows, as does their salary.

<br><br>

Other recurring non-player characters and locations recurr frequently and separate DnDTime from unbridled, improvisational chaos.  A hero may visit the Great Dump ruled by the mysterious and aloof "Trash King", become embroiled in the ancient conflict between the Math Goblins and the Trigognomes, or perhaps journey deep into the Baradac Swamp where anthropomorphic frogs and untold evils hold dominion.  These common locations and characters give a solid grounding for viewers to recognize despite our ever-changing cast of heroes.

Joining DnDTime

</div>
<br><br>
<div class="BodyFont">

DnDTime is just about as relaxed and low-commitment as you can get in the world of Dungeons & Dragons;  Because our adventures are non-continuous, there is no commitment from week to week.  To apply to joing DnDTime, head over to our Player Queue page, make comment on our Roll20 Looking For Game posting, and stop by our Discord Server and drop @DM Jeremy and @DM Pete a message!

<br><br>

Speaking of which, Roll20 is what is called a "Table Top Simulator".  It is a virual interface where players can control tokens (representing your characters and the enemies) and roll dice.  We only use Roll20 to roll dice and track character abilities.  Once you've posted on our Looking For Game posting, we can help you figure out Roll20 on the Discord Server.  Despite the prevalence of other table top tools, such as DnDBeyond, we require that players use the Roll20 built in character sheet as it speeds up dice rolling and allows us to easily review players' character sheets.

<br><br>

We use two different Roll20 lobbies for this game. The lobby you'll join initially is our staging area where you can build and test your character. Once its your turn to play in DnDTime we will provide a link to our live game lobby. This way you can update your character sheets, test your rolls, and chat in the staging lobby, without interrupting the stream.  Always make sure to update your character sheet in the staging lobby, not the live game.
If you want to use Roll20's macro functionality, refrain from creating macros which is not self-contained within your character sheet, as they will not carry over with the lobby transfer.

<br><br>

There are getting to be a lot of people interested in playing in DnDtime, and there will be weeks where we don't have enough room for everyone to fit into a game, so make sure to follow the instructions on our Player Queue web page!

The Rules of DnDTime

</div>
<br><br>
<div class="BodyFont">

We have a few requirements for participating in Pete and Jeremy's DnDTime:

<ul>
<li>Your audio quality must be reasonably clear. Push-to-Talk is strongly encouraged while playing!</li>
<li>When you play, you are expected to interact with the established adventure.  Our one-hour adventure format cannot accommodate those who go off on their own to do something unrelated to the adventure.</li>
<li>Be respectful of other players. Rude or hateful behavior will not be tolerated and may result in a ban from DnDTime, at our sole discretion.</li>
<li>You MUST consent to the Legal Agreement in our Player Queue.  The agreement serves to protect our content on Youtube, Twitch and other platforms from potential take-down claims.</li>
</ul>

We aim to be an open and friendly community for everyone, so be patient and respectful of newer players. Cursing is acceptable in DnDTime as long as it is not overly excessive or hateful.

Building a Character

<div class="BodyFont">

Once you have posted on our Roll20 Looking For Game posting, we will provide you with a digital character sheet in the staging lobby on Roll20.  For those new to Dungeons & Dragons, the following may not make a ton of sense. Feel free to ask for help on our Discord Server, or check out the free <a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules">Basic Rules</a> for guidance.

<br><br>

All DnDTime characters begin at level one.  All DnDTime character start with the Standard Array for their ability scores (plus their racial bonuses).  Homebrew content is, without exception, disallowed for character creation in DnDTime.  The Unearthed Arcana series is also disallowed.  Character creation is limited to content from the following published Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition sources: Elemental Evil Player's Companion, Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Volo's Guide to Monsters, Xanathar's Guide to Everything, and The Player's Handbook.  Summoning abilities are restricted to summoning no more than one creature at any given time for sake of expediting play.  The optional "Feats" rule is disallowed in DnDTime. The optional Multi-Classing rule is also disallowed.

Character Progression

</div>
<br><br>
<div class="BodyFont">

Each time you participate in DnDTime, you earn one experience point.  For your character to reach the next level, they must accumulate a number of experience points equal to their current level once having reached that level.  This formula makes leveling fast early on, but slower at higher levels.  In DnDTime, heroes are separated into four tiers based on their character's level: Story, Fable, Myth, and Legend.  As a character moves up in tier, they gain access to better items in Bartholomew's Shop, gain a higher salary, and are challenged with more difficult quests.  In order to move up a tier, a character must first accumulate the appropriate amount of experience and then complete a boss battle!

Boss Battles

</div>
<br><br>
<div class="BodyFont">

Once four heroes have reached the requisite levels of experience, they are sent to battle one of our unique and deadly bosses.  A spin on our Wheel of Bosses determines their foe, which range from ferocious dragons to the enigmatic Rhyme Slime.  As long as at least one character survives to defeat the boss, everyone in the party is considered to be victorious and gets to share in the spoils of victory.  Victory in a boss battle rewards double the normal slary of a character's new tier and a special bonus reward specific to each tier.

<br><br>

Fabled Battles: Our hero is rewarded with a title to be displayed on stream whenever they play.  Additionally, NPCs throughout the land of DnDTime have a chance at recognizing characters of Fable Tier status for their accomplishments.

<br><br>

Mythic Battles: No character has progressed far enough to discover the Myth Tier reward yet!

<br><br>

Legendary Battles: No character has progressed far enough to discover the Legend Tier reward yet!

Quest Failure and Death

</div>
<br><br>
<div class="BodyFont">

In the world of DnDTime death is a mere inconvenience.  If a character dies during an adventure, they are resurrected in Bartholomew's Shop after the adventure. As long as the party succeeds on the quest, the dead character will still gain an equal share of the rewards.  If a party fails to complete the quest, they will still earn experience but will not earn any Bartholomew Bucks.
